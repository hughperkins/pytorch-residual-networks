   Residual layers! Implements option (A) from Section 3.3. The input
   is passed through two 3x3 convolution filters. In parallel, if the
   number of input and output channels differ or if the stride is not
   1, then the input is downsampled or zero-padded to have the correct
   size and number of channels. Finally, the two versions of the input
   are added together.
